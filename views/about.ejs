          <p>
            Founded in 2025 by a group of passionate journalists and media
            professionals, Patrakar began as a small digital publication with a
            big vision: to create a news platform that prioritizes truth over
            sensationalism, depth over speed, and public service over profit.
            Today, Patrakar stands as a testament to the power of independent
            journalism, with a diverse team of reporters, editors, and
            contributors who share our commitment to excellence and our belief
            in the vital role that quality journalism plays in society
